A compact campus companion crafted to help students and visitors explore Chandigarh University with clarity and confidence.
Think of it as a pocket-sized pathfinder guiding you across blocks, hostels, cafés, and every bustling corner of CU.

📘 About the Project

Chandigarh University is lively, wide, and full of places you discover slowly.
This project speeds that discovery by offering:

• a visual map of the entire campus
• instant search for any block or hostel
• a smooth navigation flow
• a clean, distraction-free interface

Designed for freshers, visitors, and anyone who ever thought “Where on campus am I?”
